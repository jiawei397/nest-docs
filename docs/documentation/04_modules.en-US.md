# Modules

A module is a class with the `@Module()` decorator. The `@Module()` decorator provides metadata for Nest to organize the application structure.

Every application has at least one module, known as the **root module**. The root module serves as the starting point for Nest to build the application graphâ€”a data structure Nest uses to resolve relationships and dependencies between modules and providers. While theoretically, very small applications might have only the root module, this is not typical. It is strongly recommended to use modules as an effective way to organize components. Therefore, for most applications, the generated architecture will involve multiple modules, each encapsulating a closely related set of features.

The `@Module()` decorator takes a single object that describes the module properties.

| Key          | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `providers`  | These providers will be instantiated by the Nest injector and can be shared at least among the modules. |
| `controllers`| A set of controllers that must be instantiated within this module. |
| `imports`    | A list of modules that are imported and export the providers required in this module. |
| `exports`    | A subset of providers provided by this module, making them available in other modules that import this one. You can use either the providers themselves or just their tokens (`provide` values). |

The module encapsulates providers by default. This means that providers that don't directly belong to the current module or are not exported from the imported modules cannot be injected. Therefore, providers exported by the module can be seen as the public interface or API of the module.

## Feature Modules

`CatsController` and `CatsService` belong to the same application domain. Since they are closely related, moving them into a feature module makes sense.

Feature modules are simply a way to organize code related to a specific feature, keeping the code organized and establishing clear boundaries. This helps us manage complexity and develop according to SOLID principles, especially as the application and/or team scale.

To illustrate this, we will create a `CatsModule`.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nest';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller.ts';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service.ts';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  // providers: [CatsService],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

:::info
To create a module using the CLI, simply run `nests g` and choose `Module`.
:::

Above, we defined the `CatsModule` in the `cats.module.ts` file and moved all content related to this module into the `cats` directory. The last thing we need to do is to import this module into the root module (`AppModule`, defined in the `app.module.ts` file).


```bash
src
|-- app.module.ts
|-- cats
|   |-- cats.controller.ts
|   |-- cats.module.ts
|   |-- cats.service.ts
|   |-- dto
|   |   `-- create-cat.dto.ts
|   `-- interfaces
|       `-- cat.interface.ts
`-- main.ts
```

## Shared Modules

In Nest, modules are singleton by default, allowing you to effortlessly share the same instance of any provider across multiple modules.

Every module automatically becomes a shared module. Once created, it can be reused by any module without any additional steps.

## Global Modules

If you have to import the same set of modules everywhere, it might become tedious. Similar to Angular, providers are registered globally. Once defined, they can be used anywhere.

## Dynamic Modules

The Nest module system includes a powerful feature called Dynamic Modules. This feature allows you to easily create customizable modules that can be dynamically registered and configured by providers. Dynamic Modules are detailed here. In this chapter, we will briefly overview to complete the introduction to the modules.

Here's an example definition of a Dynamic Module for `DatabaseModule`:

```typescript
import { type DynamicModule } from "@nest";
import { ES_KEY } from "./es.constant.ts";
import { ElasticsearchService } from "./es.service.ts";
import type { ElasticSearchOptions } from "./types.ts";

export class ElasticsearchModule {
  static forRoot(options: ElasticSearchOptions): DynamicModule {
    return {
      module: ElasticsearchModule,
      providers: [{
        provide: ES_KEY,
        useValue: options,
      }, ElasticsearchService],
      global: true,
    };
  }
}
```

:::info
If you want to register a dynamic module at the global level, set the `global` property to true.
:::

You can import and configure the `ElasticsearchModule` as follows:

```typescript
import { Module } from "@nest";
import { ElasticsearchModule } from "@nest/elasticsearch";
import { AppController } from "./app.controller.ts";

@Module({
  imports: [
    ElasticsearchModule.forRoot({
      db: "http://10.100.30.65:9200",
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
